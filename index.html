            <h1>vet app for rapid test</h1>
            <p>This case study focused on how vets diagnose cancer in dogs. The goal was to design an
              application which could visualize result from a rapid test. We worked with a company which had a new
              technique of measuring blood. <br>The new technique makes it possible to discover some types of cancer in
              an earlier stage.

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p> The vet takes a blood sample and drop blood on the rapid test. Then he/she wait 10 minutes and then they
              point the mobile camera towards the rapid test. Finally, the screen will show result that can be
              transferred
              to the journal. <br><br>Today vets take blood sample and send them to a lab and haft to wait for result.
              <br>With a rapid test and an app for viewing result the procedure would be faster and more efficient.

            <h2>Good to know!</h2>
            <p> Acceptance is built on user background, experience and the perceived usefulness and usability of the
              product . <br>The interface needs to be simple and only have the function needed
              for the vets to reach their goal, it needs to present the Specificity (measure of reliability) of the test
            </p>
            <br> We also found that the image of the company behind the product affect the willingness to try new
            technique.

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p> With the application the user can overview the forest with the drone, and tag(label) objects that he/she
              are
              interested of. The app has only the most critical information needed for flying, such as battery
              strength, height of drone and direction of the drone. The application has different map layers because the
              map
              layers view different information.</p>
            <h2>Good to know!</h2>
            <p> It is important to feel in control when flying the drone. Workers in the forest are not use
              to new technology and needs an application that is easy to use and understand.
              The project owner had a plan of gathering image material to train a AI of identifying objects when flying.
              However there is a fear of feeling watched from users. Users could feel less afraid if
              they had more control over what is happening. Use of transparency is one way of giving more control to
              users.</p>
