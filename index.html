           <h1>vet app for rapid test</h1>
          <p>For 9 weeks me and three other students researched about how vets diagnose cancer in dogs, to design an application which could visualize result from a rapid test. We worked with a company which had a new technique of measuring blood, the new technique makes it possible to catch some types of cancer in an earlier stage.</p>
          <p> The vet takes a blood sample and drop blood on the rapid test. Then he/she wait 10 minutes and then they point the mobile camera towards the rapid test. Finally, the screen will show result that can be transferred to the journal. Today vets take blood sample and send them to a lab and haft to wait for result. With a rapid test and an app for viewing result the procedure would be faster and more efficient.</p>
          <p> According to our research, acceptance is built on the user background and experience and the perceived usefulness and usability of the product. The interface needs to be simple and only have the function needed for the vets to reach their goal. It is important with specificity in the test, we also found that the image of the company behind the product is important.</p>

          <h1>my forest drone application</h1>
        <p>The project was given by The Swedish forest agency. In this project I worked with four other students. We developed a design of an interface for a mobile application that helps forest workers to plan and overview the forest. The Swedish forest agency wished to motivate more workers to use drones in their workday. It was important to develop an interface that forest workers could understand.</p>
         <p> My forest drone app is a concept of a mobile application that helps forest workers to plan and overview the forest. With the application the user can overview the forest with the drone, and tagg objects that he/she are interested in marking. The app has only the most critical information needed for flying, such as battery strength, height of drone and direction of the drone. The application has different map layers because the map layers view different information.</p>
           <p> When flying a drone it is important to feel in control. A lot of workers in the forest today are not use to new technology and needs an application that is easy to use and understand.
             The project owner had a plan of gathering image material to train a AI of identifying objects when flying. However there is a fear of feeling watched from users. I have a theory that users could feel less afraid if they had more control over what is happening. Use of transparency is one way of giving more control to users. Show the users the images that has been gathered, Just a thought..</p>

          <h1>mobile Journalistic Tool</h1>
        <p> This case study was part of my bachelor thesis work in informatics - interaction design (2019). The case study aimed to understand a journalist activities and how the mobile can support the journalist in their workprocess.</p>
        This mobile application supports journalists to write, tag and publish news on the go. It supports journalist to share material quick and easy with a common file library. This wireframe are based on the companyÂ´s existing writing tool and the case study.
        The common attitude to work with the mobile as a tool are positiv. But not writing with it A mobile application could support an journalist on the way toward an assignment or when he or she happen to be at the spot of an event. The value of an mobile application is in the quick way of communicating and sharing information</div>
