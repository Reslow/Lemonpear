        <h1>vet app for rapid test</h1>
        <p>this case study focused on how vets diagnose cancer in dogs. The goal was to design an
          application which could visualize result from a rapid test. We worked with a company which had a new technique
          of measuring blood, the new technique makes it possible to catch some types of cancer in an earlier stage.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p> The vet takes a blood sample and drop blood on the rapid test. Then he/she wait 10 minutes and then they
          point the mobile camera towards the rapid test. Finally, the screen will show result that can be transferred
          to the journal. <br><br>Today vets take blood sample and send them to a lab and haft to wait for result. With a rapid
          test and an app for viewing result the procedure would be faster and more efficient.</p>
          <h2>Treasure</h2>
          <p> Acceptance is built on user background, experience and the perceived
            usefulness and usability of the product. The interface needs to be simple and only have the function needed
            for the vets to reach their goal. It is important with specificity in the test, we also found that the image
            of the company behind the product is important.</p>

        <h1>my forest drone application</h1>
        <p>The project was given by The Swedish forest agency. 
          We developed a design of an interface for a mobile application that helps forest workers to plan and overview the
          forest. One of our main goals was to motivate workers to use drones in their workday. It was
          important to develop an interface that forest workers could understand.</p>
        <img src="/src/assets/images/images/proDrone.svg" width="100%">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p> With the application the user can overview the forest with the drone, and tagg objects that he/she are
          interested in marking. The app has only the most critical information needed for flying, such as battery
          strength, height of drone and direction of the drone. The application has different map layers because the map
          layers view different information.</p>
        
      </div>
     <div class="projectImage"> <img src="/src/assets/images/images/forestapp.png" width="75%">
          <h2>Treasure</h2>
          <p> it is important to feel in control. Workers in the forest are not use
            to new technology and needs an application that is easy to use and understand.
            The project owner had a plan of gathering image material to train a AI of identifying objects when flying.
            However there is a fear of feeling watched from users. Users could feel less afraid if
            they had more control over what is happening. Use of transparency is one way of giving more control to
            users.</p>

        <h1>mobile Journalistic Tool</h1>
        <p>The casr study aimed to understand a journalist activities and how the mobile can support the journalist in their
          workprocess.</p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p> This mobile application supports journalists to write, tag and publish news on the go. It supports
            journalist to share material quick and easy with a common file library. This wireframe are based on the
            companyÂ´s existing writing tool and the case study.
          </p>
          <h2>Treasure</h2>
          <p>The common attitude to work with the mobile as a tool are positiv. But not writing with it A mobile
            application could support an journalist on the way toward an assignment or when he or she happen to be at
            the spot of an event. The value of an mobile application is in the quick way of communicating and sharing
            information</p>
