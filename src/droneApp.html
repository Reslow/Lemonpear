        <h1>my forest drone application</h1>
        <p class="pText">My forest drone was a project together with The Swedish forest agency.
          We developed an interfacedesign for a mobile application that helps forest workers to plan and
          overview the forest. One of our main goals was to motivate workers to use drones in their workday. It
          was
          important to develop an interface that forest workers could understand.</p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p class="pText"> With the application the user can overview the forest with the drone, and tag(label) objects that he/she
        are
        interested of. The app has only the most critical information needed for flying, such as battery
        strength, height of drone and direction of the drone. The application has different map layers because the
        map
        layers view different information.</p>
      <h2>Good to know!</h2>
      <p class="pText"> It is important to feel in control when flying the drone. Workers in the forest are not use
        to new technology and needs an application that is easy to use and understand.
        The project owner had a plan of gathering image material to train a AI of identifying objects when flying.
        However there is a fear of feeling watched from users. Users could feel less afraid if
        they had more control over what is happening. Use of transparency is one way of giving more control to
        users.</p>
