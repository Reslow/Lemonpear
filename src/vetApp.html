      <h1>vet app for rapid test</h1>
      <p class="pText">This case study focused on how vets diagnose cancer in dogs. The goal was to design an
        application which could visualize result from a rapid test. We worked with a company which had a new
        technique of measuring blood. <br>The new technique makes it possible to discover some types of cancer in
        an earlier stage.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p class="pText"> The vet takes a blood sample and drop blood on the rapid test. Then he/she wait 10 minutes and then they
        point the mobile camera towards the rapid test. Finally, the screen will show result that can be
        transferred
        to the journal. <br><br>Today vets take blood sample and send them to a lab and haft to wait for result.
        <br>With a rapid test and an app for viewing result the procedure would be faster and more efficient.
      </p>
      <h2>Good to know!</h2>
      <p class="pText"> Acceptance is built on user background, experience and the perceived usefulness and usability of the
        product . <br>The interface needs to be simple and only have the function needed
        for the vets to reach their goal, it needs to present the Specificity (measure of reliability) of the test
        <br> We also found that the image of the company behind the product affect the willingness to try new
        technique.
